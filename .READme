This project is looking to examine the influence of previous response times (PRTs) on peoples' target absent judegments. In previous 
literature, there is some suggestion that the overall structure of the environment can alter how much influence PRTs have on current RTs.
Though this literature was primarily focussed on no. of targets in the display or overall setsize (i.e. the total number of items in the 
display), the present study aims to investigate this effect when there will only be one target present amongst distractors that cause the 
search task to be easy or more difficult. 

The task required participants to search for a line segment tilted 45 degrees to the right and this would be present or absent on any 
given trial. The distractors were other line segments that were centred at an orientation that was orthogonal to the target line segment.
However, the degree to which they could vary about this point could change. In an easy trial, there was very little variation in the 
distractors and as such they were all pretty much orthogonal to the target, but in a difficult trial, there would be a lot of variation 
in the distractors meaning it was more difficult to identify the unique target item.

For this this study, there were 3 conditions in which participants could participate. Each participant took part in a blocked condition in
which the difficulty of the search remained constant for the entire block. They would then take part in either a random, or sine wave 
condition. In the random condition, the difficulty would change from trial to trial in no systematic way. However, in the sine wave 
condition, the difficulty would increase then decrease in a structured way (following a sine wave). 

The modelling of this data should account for the presence (or absence) of the target on current and previous trials, difficulty of the
search being carried out and the structure of the environment.
